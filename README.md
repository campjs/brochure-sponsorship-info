A brochure for CampJS sponsorship information.

1. Update the content in the HTML.
1. Open the HTML in your browser (Chrome has the best print preview + preserves hyperlinks)
1. Print the page to PDF.

I recommend we merge the latest changes to master, but create a branch for each
version of the brochure we create, so we can make changes for subsequent camps.
